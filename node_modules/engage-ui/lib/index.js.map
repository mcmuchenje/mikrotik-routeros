In the case\n * of displaying events on whole days, end dates are rounded _up_ to the next day. So an\n * event ending on `Apr 8th 12:00:00 am` will not appear on the 8th, whereas one ending\n * on `Apr 8th 12:01:00 am` will. If you want _inclusive_ ranges consider providing a\n * function `endAccessor` that returns the end date + 1 day for those events that end at midnight.\n */\n\n\nvar Calendar
